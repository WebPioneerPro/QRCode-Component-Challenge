## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I learned how to build a QR code component and apply various front-end techniques. Here are some key takeaways:

- I improved my understanding of semantic HTML and how to structure a web page for better accessibility.
- CSS custom properties allowed me to create a consistent design and easily update styles.
- Flexbox helped me achieve responsive layouts for different screen sizes.
- I practiced a mobile-first workflow, ensuring the site looks and functions well on smaller screens.

### Continued development

While working on this project, I identified areas for further improvement and development, including:

- Custom Styling: I intend to customize and fine-tune the styles applied to the card. This includes adjusting colors, fonts, and spacing to better match the overall design of the project.
- Reducing Reliance on Bootstrap: While Bootstrap is a powerful tool, I aim to reduce reliance on its classes and potentially create custom styles where needed. This will help streamline the project and reduce unnecessary CSS code.
- Optimizing Asset Loading: To improve page load times and performance, I'll explore ways to optimize asset loading, including potentially hosting Bootstrap locally or selectively including only the Bootstrap components I need.

### Useful resources

During this challenge, I found the following resources helpful:

- **[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card)** - I drew inspiration from Bootstrap's card component and used its classes as a starting point for creating the card in this project.

- **[CSS Tricks - Flexbox Guide ](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#aa-flexbox-properties)** - I referred to this guide to better understand and implement Flexbox for responsive layout design in the project.
